            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis. 
                An adaptation of the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom, 
                the screenplay of the film is written by Eric Roth. It stars Tom Hanks in the titular role, 
                alongside Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field in lead roles. 
                The film follows the life of an Alabama man named Forrest Gump (Hanks) 
                and his experiences in the 20th-century United States. </p>

                <p>Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, 
                mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used 
                to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The soundtrack 
                features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film.</p> 
                
                <p>Forrest Gump was released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and received 
                widespread critical acclaim for Zemeckis's direction, performances (particularly 
                those of Hanks and Sinise), visual effects, music, and screenplay. The film was a 
                major success at the box office: it became the top-grossing film in the United States 
                released that year and earned over US$678.2 million worldwide during its theatrical run, 
                making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind The Lion King. The soundtrack sold 
                over 12 million copies. Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, 
                Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. 
                It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, 
                and Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p> 
                
                <p>Various interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political 
                symbolism. In 2011, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the 
                United States National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</p>        
                
                <p>Forrest Gump was remade into Hindi as Laal Singh Chaddha (2022), with an adapted
                story where Aamir Khan played the protagonist.</p>

            <h1>Plot</h1>
            <p>In 1981, at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, a man named Forrest Gump recounts his life 
            story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.</p>
            <p>In 1951, in Greenbow, Alabama, young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, 
            and cannot walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their 
            home that attracts many tenants, including a young Elvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest 
            and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, 
            Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends.</p>

                <img src="entity/War Award.jpg" alt="war-award">
                <p>Forrest received the medal of honor for rescuing his platoon in the Vietnam War.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing 
            from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This 
            talent eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1963, 
            where he is coached by Bear Bryant, and witnesses Governor George Wallace's Stand in the Schoolhouse 
            Door, during which he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones. Forrest becomes a top kick returner, 
            is named on the All-American team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House.</p>
            <p>After graduating college in 1966, Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. During basic training, he befriends a 
            fellow soldier named Benjamin Buford "Bubba" Blue, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business 
            with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam, serving with the 9th Infantry Division in 
            the Mekong Delta region. After months of routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and 
            Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoon mates – including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, 
            who loses both his legs – and is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>

            <p>At the anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman and briefly reunites with Jenny, 
            who has been living a hippie lifestyle. He also develops a talent for ping-pong, and becomes a sports celebrity 
            as he competes against Chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside John Lennon on 
            The Dick Cavett Show, influencing the song "Imagine". He spends the 1971 New Year's Eve in New York City with Dan, 
            who has become an embittered cripple. Forrest soon meets President Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate 
            complex, where he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal.</p>
            <p>Discharged from the army, Forrest returns to Greenbow and endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. 
            He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in Bayou La Batre, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Dan joins 
            Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane 
            Carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, after which Dan finally thanks 
            Forrest for saving his life. Forrest returns home to his mother as she dies of cancer. Dan invests in Apple Inc. 
            and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also shares their earnings with the community and Bubba's family.</p>

            <p>In 1976, Jenny returns to stay with Forrest, recovering from years of child abuse, drugs, and prostitution. 
            After a while, Forrest proposes to her. She tells Forrest she loves him and the two have sex, but she leaves 
            the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country 
            marathon, becoming famous again before returning to Greenbow.</p>
            <p>In 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to 
            visit her. Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, who introduces him to their son, Forrest Gump Jr. Jenny tells Forrest 
            she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, and the three move back to Greenbow. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, but 
            she dies a year later. The film ends with Forrest sending his son off on his first day of school.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Forrest's Running Scene:</strong> Tom Hanks wasn’t paid upfront for the movie, but he made millions by taking percentage points from the film’s gross income. His iconic running scene cost the film nothing, as Hanks and the director paid for it themselves.</p>
                <p><strong>2. John Travolta Turned Down the Role:</strong> John Travolta was offered the role of Forrest Gump but turned it down. He later admitted it was one of the biggest mistakes of his career.</p>
                <p><strong>3. The Bench at Chippewa Square:</strong> The bench where Forrest tells his story is located in Savannah, Georgia, at Chippewa Square. It has since been moved to a museum to prevent damage from weather and tourists.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Historical Integration:</strong> The visual effects team worked hard to integrate Forrest into real historical footage, including scenes with President Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and John Lennon.</p>
